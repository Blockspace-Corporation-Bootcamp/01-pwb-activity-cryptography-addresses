# Polkadot Blockchain Academy Assignment

> Carefully read this entire document for important instructions!

The [./src/](./src/) contains modules that are self-contained sub-assignments.
Sub-assignments all begin with problem specific instructions you should review in dept.
Complete these as you see fit, and as completely as possible before the deadline.

During lectures, the instructor will specify which sections you are now equipped to complete.

## Completing the Assignment

This assignment is to be completed alongside the lectures.
At the bottom of each file, there is one or both of a `tests` module and an `optional_tests` module.
The `tests` module contains unit tests for mandatory problems, and the `optional_tests` module contains unit tests for optional problems.

Each problem is marked with a `todo!()` or `todo!("OPTIONAL")`.
It will have a corresponding test at the bottom of the file, organized in the same order as the problems.
It is recommended that you progress through the assigned functions one at a time, testing them against the provided tests and possibly writing your own before moving on.

### Collaboration Policy

For this assignment, collaboration is allowed and encouraged, as long as all students understand and write their own code.
On some short problems, it is inevitable that identical code will appear, and that's fine.
However, copying other students' code is not allowed.

## Testing your work

We have included unit tests so you can minimally check your work before submitting it for grading.
Our provided tests are intentionally light, and thus you should ensure that ass many of these test pass as possible before submitting your work.

You can compile and run a test for a specific problem by specifying the filename prefix, for example:

```sh
clear && cargo t --lib -- p1 # test only the p1_hashing tests
clear && cargo t --lib -- p3 # test only the p3_encryption tests
# etc
```

### Extended tests

Some tests are feature gated and do not run without explicitly enabling them.
Features available are listed in the [Cargo manifest](Cargo.toml).
Failing tests that explicitly emit or are marked `OPTIONAL` does not preclude the possibility of achieving a passing score.

You can compile and run a extended tests for a specific problem in this fashion:

```sh
clear && cargo t --features optional-tests --lib -- p1
# For slow tests, you should usually run them in release mode
clear && cargo t --release --features "slow-tests optional-tests" --lib -- p2
# etc
```

## Submissions and grading

Work will only be graded if pushed to the `main` branch in your private fork of this repository on Github before the deadline.
All other branches will be ignored.

### Deadline

The deadline for submission will be communicated when the assignment is first sent to you, and the Github classroom invitation link mentions this explicitly as well.
All grades will be assessed using the commit present on `main` at the time of the deadline.
All other work will be ignored.

### Automated and manual grading

The primary way we will grade your work is through an automated testing suite that is kept private to the Academy team.

> **NOTE:** This has some important implications:
>
> 1. Do not make anything private.
> 1. Do not change the name/signature of any function.
> 1. Be aware that your macros are going to be executed in different file!
>
> The private set of tests in each module will import:
> `use pba_assignment::*;` > `use pba_assignment::module_name::*;`

There are also some human-graded aspects such as:

- Ensuring that your code is of high quality and readability.
- Ensuring that your solutions are not plagiarized.
- Ensuring that you haven't imported a crate to do the heavy lifting of your code problem.
- Ensuring that you have written the actual algorithm requested in a particular problem as opposed to a different algorithm that is easier to code.
  Eg writing bubble sort when we asked for merge sort.
- Ensuring you have followed any specific directions for a problem.
  Eg used functional-style iterator methods as opposed to imperative-style loops.

### Scoring

The grading procedure yields an integer score from 0 to 4 as your grade.
A passing grading on this assignment is a score of 2.
These are guidelines for the mapping from completion to grades:

0. Less than or equal to 60% of mandatory parts completed.
1. Greater than 60% of mandatory parts completed successfully, low effort apparent from the structure of code and responses.
2. Mandatory exercises have greater than 90% of provided tests passing.
   Tests that fail show clear effort in reaching a solution.
3. Fulfil requirements for score of 2, and obtain _four points_ or more for the optional sections (defined below).
4. Clearly exceptional performance assigned by manual grading only, considering these factors:
   - Very, very close to all tests passing successfully, including the Academy's private grading test suite.
   - Clear engagement with the entirety of assignment and material.
   - Most optional sections completed.
   - Going well over the problem requirements in solutions, improving the overall problem that could be used upstream for future Academies, etc.

The optional sections point system is as follows:

- Rock-paper-scissors commit-reveal:
  - 1 point for commit-reveal message board
- Seed Phrase Converter
  - 1 point for without checksum
  - 1 point for with checksum
- Hybrid Encryption
  - 1 point for encrypting & decrypting
- Lossy Channel
  - 1 point for hash integrity protocol
- AES Modes
  - 1 point for ungroup/unpad and ECB mode
  - 1 point for CBC mode
- Attacks
  - 1/2 point for attacking alice's silly messages
  - 1/2 point for cracking password lengths

## ðŸš€ Good luck! ðŸš€
